### ✅ What to Do Next:
- Place your screenshots inside a folder named `assets/screenshots/` in your repo.
- Rename the images accordingly (`home.png`, `dashboard.png`, etc.).
- If you want me to generate these image files or write alt-text versions for accessibility, just ask!

Let me know if you want a downloadable version or want to include badges (e.g., GitHub stars, forks, license).
